# Bike-Sales-Excel-Project

# This is a project I completed on my first week it uses excel to create charts to visualise data.

# The aim was to present relationships between data in a graphical way. Presenting relationships, trends, and interfaces by examining raw text and numeric data values. This was done in order to gain insights on things such as revenue and profit.
# The data is in one table. It contains Month, Year, Customer Age, Age Group, Customer Gender, Country, State, Product Category, Sub Category, Product, Order Quantity, Unit Cost, Unit Price, Profit, Cost, and Revenue.
# To analyse, I create line charts to display revenue and profit by year and it coverd from 2017 - 2021. You can see what it looked like here ![alt text](<img width="644" height="266" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5180893-5570-42c4-a760-9a23381df246" />
