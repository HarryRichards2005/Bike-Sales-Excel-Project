# Bike-Sales-Excel-Project

# This is a project I completed on my first week it uses excel to create charts to visualise data.

<p>
The aim was to present relationships between data in a graphical way. Presenting relationships, trends, and interfaces by examining raw text and numeric data values. This was done in order to gain insights on things such as revenue and profit. The data is in one table. It contains Month, Year, Customer Age, Age Group, Customer Gender, Country, State, Product Category, Sub Category, Product, Order Quantity, Unit Cost, Unit Price, Profit, Cost, and Revenue. To analyse, I create line charts to display revenue and profit by year and it coverd from 2017 - 2021. You can see what it looked like here. 
The bike sales company wants to determine the purchasing patterns of different demographic groups to identify areas where it needs to conenctrate it marketing efforts. The complany also wants to see if there are puchasing differences between the countries where it operates.

<h2>Pivot Tables</h2>

<p>I used the pivot table to help with readibility of numerical data. I have used conditional formatting to highlight the areas that are positive, and the ones that are negative</p>
<p>This helps me understand the sales data based off age groups and countries and  provides insights to how the company can focus their marketing efforts.</p>

<h2>Pivot Table Chart</h2>

  <p>This chart graphically shows the weakest area of sales on a global scale. It also shows that adult females are buying the most products.</p>
  <p>This helps the company consider questions like why the youth age group has the lowest sales?</p>

<h2>Profit Vs. Revenue over time</h2>

<p>Based on this graph, we can see that profits and revenue increase over time. However, increase of the gap between the lines suggest that costs are rising as their profit isnt as high compared to the revenue. </p>
  <p>I have used a line graph because it helps to determine the relationship between two sets of values. Also because I needed to represent how these values change over time.</p>
  <p>I feel this graph accuratley represents how revenue vs profit changes overtime and highlights and trends, change, and how the two numbers differ.</p>

<h2>Product Revenue by Country</h2>

<p>Based on this graph, we can see how different products perform in different countries. We can learn that bikes are the most popular item across these countries. Also, the United States and Australia are the biggest buyers for bikes. This might encourage marketing campaigns in the remaning countries in an effort to increase sales.</p>
<p>I have used a column chart because I wanted to compare data across these discrete categories. It also makes it easier to highlight the highest and lowest values.</p>
<p>I feel this meets the aim as I have gained an insight on the data and interpreted them in a graphical way. I have found how the products perform in different contries and provided insights into where they might want to focus on.</p>

<h2>Revenue Comparison by Age Group</h2>

<p>Based on this pie chart we can see the what revenue is being generated by different age ranges. This graph tells us that adults aged between 35 and 64 generate the most revenue, whilst senior customers dont feel encouraged to buy anything. We can also see that under 25's also dont generate a lot of revenue. This can help a company make informed decisions on which age group they can focus on marketing towards. </p>
<p>It's best to you a pie chart because it helps me to compare the relationship between different dimensions within a specific context, this being age of customers and the revenue that they generate.</p>
<p>I feel as though I have achieved the aim by gaining certain insights on the revenue on the company and how it relates to their customer base.</p>

<h2>What have I learned</h2>
<p>I have learned how utilise visualisation features in excel</p>
<p>I have practiced the idea of turning questions into actionable insights</p>
